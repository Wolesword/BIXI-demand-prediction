# BIXI-demand-prediction

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Please find inside this repository a code which analyses the a bicylcle rental company utlilization data. This company 'BIXI' is based in MontrÃ©al QC, Canada  (https://bixi.com). It is well known for its summer deals and it offers an easy mode of transportation in busy downtown MontrÃ©al.

What I am trying to predict is the hourly demand for the bike rides considering the weather conditions. Montreal is well known for its wide variation in weather conditions (https://climate.weather.gc.ca) . Some  questions we may ask are: 

ðŸ¤” Does it influence users demand for this service?
ðŸ¤” What time has the highest demand?
ðŸ¤” What conditions are most influential to demand? (Humidity, wind speed or temperature)
ðŸ‘¯ and many more questions

Some Plots and visualisations are generated to better understand the data and gain some insight.
It is still a work in progress and open to suggestions.

NOTE: the data was prepared and merged using Alteryx.

Cheers. W
